# spectabis-next

Cross-platform graphical frontend for PCSX2 emulator to replace [.NET Framework Spectabis](https://github.com/FaithLV/Spectabis). Currently developing in my free time, feel free to contribute.
Plan is to implement most used and useful features of original Spectabis, improve code quality to encourage more contributions but most importantly, let me use PCSX2 again.
[Began as a command-line frontend for the emulator](https://github.com/FaithLV/spectabis-cli), but that's too much effort for too little return.

## Current Technology Stack
* .NET Core
* Avalonia UI

## Platforms
* Linux (the point of the whole project)
* Windows (obviously)

Support for Mac OS is possible, not a priority. I won't go out of my way to make sure it works there though.

## Must Have Features
* Per-game configurations
* Box-art Scraping
* Basic emulator setting configuration
* Global Controller profiles

## Nice to have
* Plugin configuration
* Controller support
* Couch mode
